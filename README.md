# Khroma

## A color-recognizing app to help those with colorblindness

## How To Use
&nbsp;&nbsp;The /index.html page is the former working prototype of the project (although now it is currently non-functional). To use the app, go to the [/public/temp-videopage.html page](https://byrdsr1.github.io/app-project/public/temp-videopage.html) and go to home. From there, the app should work as expected.
